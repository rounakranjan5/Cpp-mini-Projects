Here I have some java programming project which was assigned during CodSoft internship program,
- _TASK 1_
   - [X] **NUMBER GAME** : A program that generates a random number and asks the user to guess it. Provide feedback on whether the guess is too high or too low until the user guesses the correct number and display the total score.
   

- _TASK 2_
  - [X] **SIMPLE CALCULATOR** :  A calculator program that performs basic arithmetic
operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and
division. Allow the user to input two numbers and choose an
operation to perform.
- _TASK 3_
    - [X] **TIC-TAC-TOE GAME** : A simple console-based Tic-Tac-Toe game that
allows two players to play against each other
